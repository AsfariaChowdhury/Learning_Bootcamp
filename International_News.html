			PROTEST AGAINST CONTROVERSIAL AGRICULTURE LAWS IN INDIA 
			</h2></p><br></br>
			<p><h1><strong>
			Farmers stage nationwide strike
			</strong></h1></p><br></br>
			<p><h5>
			Railway tracks and highways were blocked across India as 
			farmers launched a national day of action yesterday against 
			reforms deregulating the agriculture sector, upping the 
			stakes after 10 days blockading the capital. 
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Tens of thousands of farmers have set up barricades on roads 
			into New Delhi since November 26, vowing not to move until 
			the laws are repealed in one of the biggest challenges to the
			Hindu nationalist government since it was re-elected in a 
			landslide in 2019.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"We are worried, extremely worried. Our children will starve,
			what could be a bigger worry than this?," farmer Ved Singh 
			told AFP ahead of the strike, echoing fears of his peers that
			large corporations would lower prices and destroy their 
			livelihoods.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"There would be nothing to eat... How will we earn money? 
			This is the biggest worry for us."
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Authorities put on extra police in Delhi and boosted security
			in the rest of the country in a bid to head off any trouble.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			The farmers were supported in their call for action yesterday
			by railway workers, truck drivers, teachers and other unions.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			In many eastern and western states, protesters blocked 
			railway tracks, roads and halted trains.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"We want to support the farmers' cause," a senior leader from
			the Communist Party of India told AFP in eastern West Bengal 
			state.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			The blockade and strike have taken on a political dimension 
			with the national ruling Bharatiya Janata Party accusing 
			opposition parties of opportunism by rejecting measures they 
			had called for when in power.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Common Man Party said 
			he had been placed "under house arrest" since Monday by Delhi
			Police, which is controlled by the national government, after
			he visited the farmers' blockade site. Police denied the
			claim.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Footage posted on Twitter showed an opposition Congress 
			leader in western Gujarat state riding a scooter being chased
			by a police vehicle as he sought to join the strike.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Five rounds of talks have failed to narrow differences 
			between farmers and ministers.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			The laws will allow farmers to sell their produce on the open
			market -- including to supermarket chains -- instead of 
			through state-run organisations that guarantee a minimum 
			price. Farmers say the industry will be taken over by major 
			firms that will force prices down.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			The farmers are strongest in the north, but even the 
			government in the southern Karnataka state suspended online 
			school lessons for the day to show support.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Fresh talks on the reforms will be held today. 
			</p><br></br>
