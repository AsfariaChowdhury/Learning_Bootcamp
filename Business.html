			Bangladesh now a development model
			</h2></p><br></br>
			<p><h4><em>
			Says Turkish ambassador
			</em></h4></p><br></br>
			<img src = "D:\NSU ACM-W\Learning_Bootcamp\Image_Folder\Business_Img1.jpg">
			<h5><p>
			Turkish Ambassador Mustafa Osman Turan has said his country 
			wants to make an increased investment in Bangladesh and raise
			the bilateral trade volume through product diversification.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Bangladesh has a very bright future and its economy is 
			growing fast like Turkey, he said.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"Turkish investors are keen to invest in Bangladesh as it 
			offers attractive incentives for foreign investors," he told 
			news agency UNB in an interview at his office.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			The envoy who came to Bangladesh just before the Covid-19 
			outbreak said a prominent Turkish company will invest $100 
			million in the liquefied petroleum gas sector in Chattogram. 
			"That will be an initial investment."
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Turan said improving bilateral trade, boosting investment in
			Bangladesh and enhancing cultural and people-to-people ties 
			will be among his priorities during his tenure in Bangladesh.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"As an envoy, there's always a desire to do something more," 
			he said, adding that he is lucky to see the positive 
			atmosphere in place created by his predecessors to take 
			forward the relations to a new height.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"We're happy that our economic and trade relations are 
			improving," said the envoy, who also served in Italy, 
			Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Austria, Afghanistan and 
			Belgium.
			</p><br></br>'
			<p>
			The Turkish envoy said they buy a lot of jute products from 
			Bangladesh and will explore other areas saying the two 
			countries can always diversify their trade.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"Bangladesh has a very strong pharmaceutical industry and a 
			growing IT industry," he said, adding that the agro 
			industries, light-engineering, services sector, tourism and 
			health sectors are some promising areas of cooperation.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Around $1 billion worth of trade takes place between the two 
			nations every year and scope is there to increase it further,
			he said.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			The bilateral trade volume in the first 10 months of the 
			current year stood at $754 million, which is equivalent to 
			that of 2019, he said.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			"That's good news indeed! We kept the same level of trade 
			despite the pandemic where other countries are experiencing a
			significant drop in their trade volumes. This year, the trade
			balance is in favour of Bangladesh as Bangladesh is selling a
			lot of jute products to Turkey."
			</p><br></br><p>
			Turkey mainly ships raw materials, agriculture and food 
			products, textile and agriculture machinery and textile 
			chemicals to Bangladesh while imports jute yarns and twine, 
			jute manufacturers' knitwear and readymade garments.
			</p><br></br><p>
			On Turkish companies' presence in Bangladesh, the ambassador 
			said Turkey's leading home appliance manufacturer Arçelik has
			bought majority shares of Singer Bangladesh and made it quite
			profitable.
			</p><br></br><p>
			The Turkish company thinks Singer Bangladesh's business will
			benefit significantly from the sale as Arçelik is a much 
			larger and financially stronger company with a worldwide 
			reputation in the home appliance sector.
			</p><br></br><p>
			The Turkish investors are interested to invest in a special
			economic zone as Bangladesh offers quite attractive 
			incentives for investment, he said.
			</p><br></br><p>
			"We're going to organise a virtual meeting among businesses 
			of the two countries to identify areas of cooperation and
			explore opportunities jointly."
			</p><br></br><p>
			Top executives of Bangladesh Investment Development 
			Authority, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce 
			and Industry and Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey
			will take part in the discussion.
			</p><br></br><p>
			Turkish contracting companies are also interested in mega 
			infrastructure projects in Bangladesh, he said.
			</p><br></br><p>
			The ambassador, who joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
			Turkey in 1992, said 50 years have been quite a significant
			journey for Bangladesh.
			</p><br></br><p>
			"Bangladesh is progressing in a speedy way with an impressive
			development achieved in the last 10 years under the 
			leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. In the last 
			decade, Bangladesh has become a model for many developing 
			countries," he said.
			</p><br></br><p>
			Bangladesh has got a solid foundation given by Father of the
			Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and today 
			Bangladesh is a much-respected nation globally, he said.
			</p><br></br><p>
			He said Bangladesh's foreign policy "Friendship to all,
			malice to none" is coinciding with Turkey's foreign policy 
			motto "peace at home, peace in the world".
			</p><br></br><p>
			Bangladesh is making significant contributions to global 
			peace through its robust engagement with the UN peacekeeping
			operations.
			</p><br></br><p>
			"Therefore, it will be a very well-deserved celebration for
			Bangladesh, its people and the government of Bangladesh."
			</p><br></br><p>
			While virtually inaugurating the newly-built Bangladesh 
			embassy complex in Ankara on September 14, the Bangladeshi
			premier invited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
			through Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
			</p><br></br><p>
			A fruitful discussion has taken place with a number of
			ministers in Bangladesh regarding cooperation between the 
			two countries in the coming years, the ambassador said.
			</p><br></br><p>
			Turkey wants to establish a hospital in Dhaka as the Western
			Asian country has vast experience in the sector. "That's one
			of the big projects in our mind. We would like to share our 
			experience."
			</p><br></br><p>
			"Turkey has become one of the top five destinations for 
			health tourism in the world and it could be another 
			destination for those Bangladeshis who go abroad for better
			treatment."
			</p><br></br><p>
			He also said Turkey wants to boost cultural exchanges and
			academic cooperation to help Turkish and Bangladeshi people 
			learn more about each other.
			</p><br></br><p>
			He also appreciated Bangladesh's efforts in dealing with the
			Covid-19 situation.
			</p><br></br><p>
			The Turkish health ministry has provided five tonnes of 
			medical supplies to Bangladesh, including masks, personal
			protective equipment and ventilators, he said.
			</p><br></br><p>
			He said Turkey provided medical supplies to 150 countries and
			Bangladesh is one of those countries.
