			Climate change devastated dinosaurs not once, but twice
			</h2></p><br></br>

			<h5><p>
			Most people know that land-dwelling dinosaurs were wiped out 
			some 66 million years ago when an asteroid roughly twice the 
			diameter of Paris crashed into Earth. If the explosive 
			fireball didn't get them, the plunge in global temperature on
			a planet with little or no ice -- caused by a blanket of 
			heat-shielding debris in the atmosphere -- did.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			What most people don't know is that more than 100 million 
			years earlier, another climate change cataclysm devastated a 
			different set of dinosaur species, with many going extinct.
			Except for this time, it was global warming rather than 
			global cooling that did them in, with the planet heating up 
			more quickly than the dinos' capacity to adapt.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Scientists have found evidence of this traumatic event some 
			179 million years ago in plant fossils in Argentine 
			Patagonia. They also discovered a previously unknown 
			dinosaur. The species, called Bagualia alba, is in the family
			of massive, long-necked sauropods, the largest animals to 
			walk the Earth. Before the global warming event, sauropods
			were only one branch of the Sauropodomorpha lineage.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Other dinosaurs in the same group were smaller and lightly 
			built, with some no bigger than a goat, according to a study 
			published Wednesday in the Royal Society. But a series of 
			volcanic eruptions over several million years released 
			huge amounts of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere, warming
			the planet and transforming the vegetation dinosaurs fed on.
			The climate went from a temperate, warm and humid with 
			diverse lush vegetation to a strongly seasonal, 
			hot-and-dry regime.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Smaller Sauropodomorpha dinosaurs were unable to cope with 
			the change, but larger sauropods -- like the Bagualia alba --
			thrived. "Sauropods are massive, four-legged animals with 
			long necks," which meant they could reach the tops of trees, 
			palaeontologist and lead author Diego Pol told AFP. "Their 
			very robust mandibles and spoon-shaped teeth were adapted to
			feed on all kinds of plants such as conifer trees. "Conifers
			in the early Jurassic had tough and leathery leaves that 
			would be a challenge for any herbivore. But that gave 
			B. alba an advantage over other Sauropodomorpha dinosaurs, 
			said Pol, head of the science department at the Egidio 
			Feruglio palaeontology museum in Patagonia.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			Sauropods' new diet saw them expanded in size from 10 metres
			to 40 metres in length, as large digestion chambers were 
			needed to cope. They became the dominant group of herbivores
			and eventually the largest animals to ever walk the Earth.
